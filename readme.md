subdomain bruteforce for windows is best used in conjunction with other tools - combining their results and dupekilling them.
it uses async get requests to brute force subdomains and is pretty fast and accurate over p80/443. 

**install and use**<br/>
download and unzip https://github.com/visualbasic6/subdomainbruteforce/archive/master.zip. it's in \bin

**roadmap, misc. notes**<br/>
i may add multi-host support, [recursion](https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion), web spidering, directory and
file enumeration in the future. as well as making it more traditionally user friendly.  re: file/directory scanning- 
dirbuster for linux is handy (and wonderful) but it only targets one host at a time and doesn't discover subdomains.
[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) looks incredible as well. that's written in go and seems fast and feature rich.
the future of this *prog* may involve the addition of [several features](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/b202a2/subdomain_bruteforce_for_windows/eiqda66/), a name change and focus on point and click simplicity.
